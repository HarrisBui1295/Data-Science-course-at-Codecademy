-- Real World Project #2: Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help their finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing. This dataset contains a single table, transaction_data.

-- List all the columns from the table
SELECT * 
FROM transaction_data
LIMIT 10;

-- Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.
SELECT full_name, email 
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip = 20252;

-- The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name. Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.
SELECT name, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name = 'ART Vandelay' 
OR full_name LIKE '% der %';

-- There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from. For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use. We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service. Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.
SELECT ip_address, email 
FROM transaction_data 
WHERE ip_address LIKE '10.%';

-- Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.
SELECT email 
FROM transaction_data
WHERE email LIKE '%temp_email.com';

-- The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’. Can you find the transaction?
SELECT * 
FROM transaction_data 
WHERE ip_address LIKE '120.%'
AND full_name LIKE 'JOHN%';
